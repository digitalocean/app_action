# Deploy a [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/) app using GitHub Actions.

Deploy an app from source (including the configuration) on commit, while allowing you to run tests or perform other operations as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

- Supports picking up an in-repository (or filesystem really) `app.yaml` (defaults to `.do/app.yaml`, configurable via the `app_spec_location` input) to create the app from instead of having to rely on an already existing app that's then downloaded (though that is still supported). The in-filesystem app spec can also be templated with environment variables automatically (see examples below).
- Prints the build and deploy logs into the Github Action log on demand (configurable via `print_build_logs` and `print_deploy_logs`) and surfaces them as outputs `build_logs` and `deploy_logs`.
- Provides the app's metadata as the output `app`.
- Supports a "preview mode" geared towards orchestrating per-PR app previews. It can be enabled via `deploy_pr_review`, see the [Implementing Preview Apps](#launch-a-preview-app-per-pull-request) example.

## Documentation

### `deploy` action

#### Inputs

- `token`: DigitalOcean Personal Access Token. See https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/ for creating a new token.
- `app_spec_location`: Location of the app spec file. Defaults to `.do/app.yaml`.
- `project_id`: ID of the project to deploy the app to. If not given, the app will be deployed to the default project.
- `app_name`: Name of the app to pull the spec from. The app must already exist. If an app name is given, a potential in-repository app spec is ignored.
- `print_build_logs`: Print build logs. Defaults to `false`.
- `print_deploy_logs`: Print deploy logs. Defaults to `false`.
- `deploy_pr_preview`: Deploy the app as a PR preview. The app name will be derived from the PR, the app spec will be modified to exclude conflicting configuration like domains and alerts and all Github references to the current repository will be updated to point to the PR's branch. Defaults to `false`.

#### Outputs

- `app`: A JSON representation of the entire app after the deployment.
- `build_logs`: The builds logs of the deployment.
- `deploy_logs`: The deploy logs of the deployment.

### `delete` action

#### Inputs

- `token`: DigitalOcean Personal Access Token. See https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/ for creating a new token.
- `app_id`: ID of the app to delete.
- `app_name`: Name of the app to delete.
- `from_pr_preview`: Use this if the app was deployed as a PR preview. The app name will be derived from the PR and.
- `ignore_not_found`: Ignore if the app is not found.

## Usage

As a prerequisite for all examples, you'll need a `DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN`[secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) in the respective repository. If not already done, get a DigitalOcean Personal Access token by following this [instructions](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) and declare it as that secret in the repository you're working with.

### Deploy an app (with a referenced secret)

With the following contents of `.do/app.yaml` in the repository:

```yaml
name: sample
services:
- name: sample
  envs:
  - key: SOME_SECRET
    value: ${SOME_SECRET_FROM_REPOSITORY}
    type: SECRET
  github:
    branch: main
    repo: digitalocean/sample-nodejs
```

The following action deploys the app whenever a new commit is pushed to the main branch. Note that `deploy_on_push` is **not** used here, since the Github Action is the driving force behind the deployment. Updates to `.do/app.yaml` will automatically be applied to the app.

In this case, a secret of the repository named `SOME_SECRET_FROM_REPOSITORY` will also be passed into the app via its environment variables as `SOME_SECRET`. It is passed to the action's environment via the `${{ secrets.KEY }}` notation and then substituted into the spec itself via the environment variable reference in `value`. Make sure to define the respective env var's type as `SECRET` in the spec to ensure the value is stored in an encrypted way.

```yaml
name: Update App

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy-app:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy the app
        uses: digitalocean/app_action/deploy@v2
        env:
          SOME_SECRET_FROM_REPOSITORY: ${{ secrets.SOME_SECRET_FROM_REPOSITORY }}
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

### Deploy an app with a prebuilt image

With the following contents of `.do/app.yaml` in the repository:

```yaml
name: sample
services:
- name: sample
  image:
    registry_type: GHCR
    registry: YOUR_ORG
    repository: YOUR_REPO
    digest: ${SAMPLE_DIGEST}
```

The following action builds a new image from a Dockerfile in the repository and deploys the respective app from it. The build in App Platform is automatically bypassed. The built image is deployed from its digest, avoiding any inconsistencies around mutable tags and guaranteeing that **exactly** this image is deployed.

```yaml
name: Build, Push and Deploy a Docker Image

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-push-deploy-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Log in to the Container registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v3.3.0
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        id: push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v6.5.0
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:latest
      - name: Deploy the app
        uses: digitalocean/app_action/deploy@v2
        env:
          SAMPLE_DIGEST: ${{ steps.push.outputs.digest }}
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

### Launch a preview app per pull request

With the following contents of `.do/app.yaml` in the repository:

```yaml
name: sample
services:
- name: sample
  github:
    branch: main
    repo: digitalocean/sample-nodejs
```

The following 2 actions implement a "Preview Apps" feature, that provide a per-PR app to check if the deployment **would** work. If the deployment succeeds, a comment is posted with the live URL of the app. If the deployment fails, a link to the respective action run is posted alongside the build and deployment logs for quick debugging.

Once the PR is closed or merged, the respective app is deleted again.

```yaml
name: App Platform Preview

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  test:
    name: preview
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy the app
        id: deploy
        uses: digitalocean/app_action/deploy@v2
        with:
          deploy_pr_preview: "true"
          token: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
      - uses: actions/github-script@v7
        env:
          BUILD_LOGS: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.build_logs }}
          DEPLOY_LOGS: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.deploy_logs }}
        with:
          script: |
            const { BUILD_LOGS, DEPLOY_LOGS } = process.env
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: `:rocket: :rocket: :rocket: The app was successfully deployed at ${{ fromJson(steps.deploy.outputs.app).live_url }}.`
            })
      - uses: actions/github-script@v7
        if: failure()
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: `The app failed to be deployed. Logs can be found [here](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}).

              ## Logs
              <details>
              <summary>Build logs</summary>

              \`\`\`
              ${BUILD_LOGS}
              \`\`\`
              </details>

              <details>
              <summary>Deploy logs</summary>

              \`\`\`
              ${DEPLOY_LOGS}
              \`\`\`
              </details>`
            })
```

```yaml
name: Delete Preview

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [ closed ]

jobs:
  closed:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: delete preview app
        uses: digitalocean/app_action/delete@v2
        with:
          from_pr_preview: "true"
          ignore_not_found: "true"
          token: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

## Note for handling container images

It is strongly suggested to use image digests to identify a specific image like in the example above. If that is not possible, it is strongly suggested to use a unique and descriptive tag for the respective image (not `latest`).

## Upgrade from v1.x

The v1 branch of this action is no longer under active development. Its documentation is [still available](https://github.com/digitalocean/app_action/blob/v1/README.md) though.

To upgrade, the reference to the action has to be changed from `digitalocean/app_action@v1.x.x` to `digitalocean/app_action/deploy@v2.x.x` (note the new `deploy` part of the path).

### Updating images

The new deploy action does not support the `images` input from the old action. For in-repository app specs, it's suggested to use env-var-substitution as in the example above. 

If the spec of an existing app should be updated via the backwards-compatible `app_name` input, the `IMAGE_DIGEST_$component-name` environment variable can be used to update the `digest` field and the `IMAGE_TAG_$component-name` environment variables can be used to update the `tag` field of a component's image reference.

```yaml
name: sample-app
services:
- name: sample-service
  image:
    registry_type: GHCR
    registry: YOUR_ORG
    repository: YOUR_REPO
    tag: v1
```

```yaml
- name: Deploy the app
  uses: digitalocean/app_action/deploy@v2
  env:
    IMAGE_TAG_SAMPLE_SERVICE: v2
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    app_name: sample-app
```

In this example, the tag of the referenced image (hence the `IMAGE_TAG_` prefix) of the `sample-service` will be updated from `v1` to `v2`. Service names are translated to environment variable names by uppercasing them and by replacing dashes with underscores (`service-name` to `SERVICE_NAME` in this case).
